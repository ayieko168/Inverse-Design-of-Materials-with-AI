# Masterplan: AI for Inverse Design in Material Science

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI model capable of generating new material structures and compositions based on desired properties. The model will be trained on a large dataset of existing materials and their properties, enabling it to learn the relationship between structure/composition and properties. The primary goals are:

1. Achieve 90% accuracy in predicting material properties from structures.
2. Generate novel materials with specified properties, with a 70% success rate in computational validation.
3. Reduce the time for new material discovery by 50% compared to traditional methods.

Potential applications include developing new semiconductors for electronics, lightweight materials for aerospace, and energy-efficient materials for construction.

## 3. Model Architecture
### 3.1 Generator
Primary approach: Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder
Alternative approaches to explore:
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) generator
- Transformer-based models for sequence generation of crystal structures

Rationale: VAE provides a continuous latent space beneficial for optimization, while GNN effectively captures the graph-like nature of crystal structures.

Input: Desired material properties
Output: Material structure (graph representation) and composition (element probabilities)

### 3.2 Discriminator/Validator
Primary approach: Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms
Alternative approach: 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) with periodic boundary conditions

Rationale: GNN can effectively process the graph structure of materials while attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on relevant atomic interactions.

Input: Generated material structure and composition
Output: Predicted properties and validity score

### 3.3 Ensemble Approach
Implement an ensemble of different model architectures to improve robustness and performance.

## 4. Training Process
### 4.1 Loss Functions
- Reconstruction loss for VAE: Î²-VAE formulation to balance reconstruction and KL divergence
- Property prediction loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE) for continuous properties, Cross-Entropy for categorical properties
- Physics-based constraints loss: Incorporate domain knowledge (e.g., charge neutrality, bond angle distributions)
- Adversarial loss (if GAN is used): Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty

### 4.2 Training Strategy
- Pre-train the discriminator/validator on the existing dataset
- Implement curriculum learning: start with simple structures and gradually increase complexity
- Use cyclical learning rates to escape local minima
- Employ early stopping based on validation performance
- Implement Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation

### 4.3 Regularization Techniques

- Uniqueness score: percentage of non-duplicate generations (target: >99%)
- Diversity measure: Jensen-Shannon divergence between property distributions of generated and real materials
- Synthesizability score: predicted likelihood of successful experimental synthesis

Success Criteria:
